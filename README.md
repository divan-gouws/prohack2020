Important bits:

The solutions are evaluated on two criteria: predicted future Index values and allocated energy from a newly discovered star

1. Index predictions are evaluated using RMSE metric
2. Energy allocation is also evaluated using RMSE metric and has a set of known factors that need to be taken into account.

Every galaxy has a certain limited potential for improvement in the index described by the following function:

Potential for increase in the Index = -np.log(Index+0.01)+3
Likely index increase dependent on potential for improvement and on extra energy availability is described by the following function:
Likely increase in the Index = extra energy * Potential for increase in the Index **2 / 1000

There are also several constraints:
in total there are 50000 zillion DSML available for allocation and no galaxy at a point in time should be allocated more than 100 zillion DSML or less than 0 zillion DSML. Galaxies with low existence expectancy index below 0.7 should be allocated at least 10% of the total energy available in the foreseeable future

3. Leaderboard is based on a combined scaled metric:
80% prediction task RMSE + 20% optimization task RMSE * lambda where lambda is a normalizing factor

4. Leaderboard is 80% public and 20% private
